# 8-Bit PCB CPU

This is my version of [Ben Eaters 8-bit breadboard SAP-1 CPU](https://eater.net/8bit), converted to a PCB. I have made some minor changes as I could not find all of the components as listed in Ben's part list.

## Major Changes

### Random Access Memory

1. RAM IC's have been replaced with ATMega328-PU's. This should allow me to have persistant programs between power cycles.
